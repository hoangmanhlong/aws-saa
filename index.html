<strong>Question 58:</strong> A company is designing the architecture
        for a new mobile app that uses the AWS Cloud. The company uses
        organizational units (OUs) in AWS Organizations to manage its accounts.
        The company wants to tag Amazon EC2 instances with data sensitivity by
        using values of sensitive and nonsensitive. IAM identities must not be
        able to delete a tag or create instances without a tag.Which combination

        purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the
        company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate
        new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in
        size.Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have
        uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII)
        that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to
        be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate
        remediation.What should a solutions architect do to meet these
        requirements with the LEAST development effort?

<strong>Question 82:</strong> A company has a three-tier web application
        that processes orders from customers. The web tier consists of Amazon
        EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The processing tier
        consists of EC2 instances. The company decoupled the web tier and
        processing tier by using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). The
        storage layer uses Amazon DynamoDB.At peak times, some users report
        order processing delays and halls. The company has noticed that during
        these delays, the EC2 instances are running at 100% CPU usage, and the
        SQS queue fills up. The peak times are variable and unpredictable.The
        company needs to improve the performance of the application.Which
        solution will meet these requirements?
      </p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">
<span>A.Use scheduled scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to scale out
            the processing tier instances for the duration of peak usage times.

<strong>Question 180:</strong> A company hosts a multi-tier web
        application that uses an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster for storage. The
        application tier is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. The company's IT
        security guidelines mandate that the database credentials be encrypted
        and rotated every 14 days.What should a solutions architect do to meet
        this requirement with the LEAST operational effort?
      </p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">
<span>A.Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key.
            Use AWS Secrets Manager to create a new secret that uses the KMS key
            with the appropriate credentials. Associate the secret with the
            Aurora DB cluster. Configure a custom rotation period of 14
            days.</span>
</li>
<li class="answer">
<span>B.Create two parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: one
            for the user name as a string parameter and one that uses the
            SecureString type for the password. Select AWS Key Management
            Service (AWS KMS) encryption for the password parameter, and load
            these parameters in the application tier. Implement an AWS Lambda
            function that rotates the password every 14 days.</span>
</li>
<li class="answer">
<span>C.Store a file that contains the credentials in an AWS Key
            Management Service (AWS KMS) encrypted Amazon Elastic File System
            (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system in all EC2
            instances of the application tier. Restrict the access to the file
            on the file system so that the application can read the file and
            that only super users can modify the file. Implement an AWS Lambda
            function that rotates the key in Aurora every 14 days and writes new
            credentials into the file.</span>

<span>D.Store a file that contains the credentials in an AWS Key
            Management Service (AWS KMS) encrypted Amazon S3 bucket that the
            application uses to load the credentials. Download the file to the
            application regularly to ensure that the correct credentials are
            used. Implement an AWS Lambda function that rotates the Aurora
            credentials every 14 days and uploads these credentials to the file

<strong>Question 220:</strong> A company is building a cloud-based
        application on AWS that will handle sensitive customer data. The
        application uses Amazon RDS for the database, Amazon S3 for object
        storage, and S3 Event Notifications that invoke AWS Lambda for
        serverless processing.The company uses AWS IAM Identity Center to manage
        user credentials. The development, testing, and operations teams need
        secure access to Amazon RDS and Amazon S3 while ensuring the
        confidentiality of sensitive customer data. The solution must comply
        with the principle of least privilege.Which solution meets these
        requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

<strong>Question 258:</strong> A solutions architect runs a web
        application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances that are in individual
        target groups behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Users can reach
        the application through a public website.The solutions architect wants
        to allow engineers to use a development version of the website to access
        one specific development EC2 instance to test new features for the
        application. The solutions architect wants to use an Amazon Route 53
        hosted zone to give the engineers access to the development instance.
        The solution must automatically route to the development instance even
        if the development instance is replaced.Which solution will meet these
        requirements?

<strong>Question 307:</strong> An image-processing company has a web
        application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the
        images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event
        notifications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple
        Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the

        sends the results to users through email.Users report that they are
        receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions

<strong>Question 315:</strong> A medical records company is hosting an
        application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes customer
        data files that are stored on Amazon S3. The EC2 instances are hosted in
        public subnets. The EC2 instances access Amazon S3 over the internet,
        but they do not require any other network access.A new requirement
        mandates that the network traffic for file transfers take a private
        route and not be sent over the internet.Which change to the network

<strong>Question 405:</strong> A company runs an online marketplace web
        application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of
        users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable, near-real-time
        solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with
        several other internal applications. Transactions also need to be
        processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document
        database for low-latency retrieval.What should a solutions architect
        recommend to meet these requirements?
      </p>
<ul>

<strong>Question 501:</strong> An image hosting company uploads its
        large assets to Amazon S3 Standard buckets. The company uses multipart
        upload in parallel by using S3 APIs and overwrites if the same object is
        uploaded again. For the first 30 days after upload, the objects will be
        accessed frequently. The objects will be used less frequently after 30
        days, but the access patterns for each object will be inconsistent. The
        company must optimize its S3 storage costs while maintaining high

<strong>Question 546:</strong> A company has a multi-tier application
        deployed on several Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. An
        Amazon RDS for Oracle instance is the application’ s data layer that
        uses Oracle-specific PL/SQL functions. Traffic to the application has
        been steadily increasing. This is causing the EC2 instances to become
        overloaded and the RDS instance to run out of storage. The Auto Scaling
        group does not have any scaling metrics and defines the minimum healthy
        instance count only. The company predicts that traffic will continue to
        increase at a steady but unpredictable rate before leveling off.What
        should a solutions architect do to ensure the system can automatically
        scale for the increased traffic? (Choose two.)

<strong>Question 574:</strong> A company stores text files in Amazon S3.
        The text files include customer chat messages, date and time
        information, and customer personally identifiable information (PII).The
        company needs a solution to provide samples of the conversations to an
        external service provider for quality control. The external service
        provider needs to randomly pick sample conversations up to the most
        recent conversation. The company must not share the customer PII with
        the external service provider. The solution must scale when the number
        of customer conversations increases.Which solution will meet these
        requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
      </p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">
<span>A.Create an Object Lambda Access Point. Create an AWS Lambda
            function that redacts the PII when the function reads the file.
            Instruct the external service provider to access the Object Lambda
            Access Point.</span>
</li>
<li class="answer">
<span>B.Create a batch process on an Amazon EC2 instance that regularly
            reads all new files, redacts the PII from the files, and writes the
            redacted files to a different S3 bucket. Instruct the external
            service provider to access the bucket that does not contain the
            PII.B. Create a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance that
            presents a list of the files, redacts the PII from the files, and
            allows the external service provider to download new versions of the
            files that have the PII redacted.</span>
</li>
<li class="answer">
<span>D.Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create an AWS Lambda function
            that reads only the data in the files that does not contain PII.
            Configure the Lambda function to store the non-PII data in the
            DynamoDB table when a new file is written to Amazon S3. Grant the
            external service provider access to the DynamoDB table.</span>

<strong>Question 645:</strong> A company uses AWS Organizations with all
        features enabled and runs multiple Amazon EC2 workloads in the
        ap-southeast-2 Region. The company has a service control policy (SCP)
        that prevents any resources from being created in any other Region. A
        security policy requires the company to encrypt all data at rest.An
        audit discovers that employees have created Amazon Elastic Block Store
        (Amazon EBS) volumes for EC2 instances without encrypting the volumes.
        The company wants any new EC2 instances that any IAM user or root user
        launches in ap-southeast-2 to use encrypted EBS volumes. The company
        wants a solution that will have minimal effect on employees who create
        EBS volumes.Which combination of steps will meet these requirements?

<strong>Question 693:</strong> A transaction processing company has
        weekly scripted batch jobs that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2
        instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The number of transactions can
        vary, but the baseline CPU utilization that is noted on each run is at
        least 60%. The company needs to provision the capacity 30 minutes before
        the jobs run.Currently, engineers complete this task by manually
        modifying the Auto Scaling group parameters. The company does not have
        the resources to analyze the required capacity trends for the Auto

<strong>Question 730:</strong> A company has an application that serves
        clients that are deployed in more than 20.000 retail storefront
        locations around the world. The application consists of backend web
        services that are exposed over HTTPS on port 443. The application is
        hosted on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer
        (ALB). The retail locations communicate with the web application over
        the public internet. The company allows each retail location to register
        the IP address that the retail location has been allocated by its local
        ISP.The company's security team recommends to increase the security of
        the application endpoint by restricting access to only the IP addresses
        registered by the retail locations.What should a solutions architect do
        to meet these requirements?

<strong>Question 732:</strong> A company runs an on-premises application
        that is powered by a MySQL database. The company is migrating the
        application to AWS to increase the application's elasticity and
        availability.The current architecture shows heavy read activity on the
        database during times of normal operation. Every 4 hours, the company's

<strong>Question 805:</strong> A solutions architect is designing a
        multi-tier application for a company. The application's users upload
        images from a mobile device. The application generates a thumbnail of
        each image and returns a message to the user to confirm that the image
        was uploaded successfully.The thumbnail generation can take up to 60
        seconds, but the company wants to provide a faster response time to its
        users to notify them that the original image was received. The solutions
        architect must design the application to asynchronously dispatch
        requests to the different application tiers.What should the solutions
        architect do to meet these requirements?
      </p>
<ul>
<li class="answer">
<span>A.Write a custom AWS Lambda function to generate the thumbnail and

<strong>Question 815:</strong> A company recently migrated its web
        application to the AWS Cloud. The company uses an Amazon EC2 instance to
        run multiple processes to host the application. The processes include an
        Apache web server that serves static content. The Apache web server
        makes requests to a PHP application that uses a local Redis server for
        user sessions.The company wants to redesign the architecture to be
        highly available and to use AWS managed solutions.Which solution will
        meet these requirements?
      </p>

        to an NFS share every 5 minutes. The visualization application is a
        Windows desktop application that displays the simulation output and
        requires an SMB file system.The company maintains two synchronized file
        systems. This strategy is causing data duplication and inefficient
        resource usage. The company needs to migrate the applications to AWS
        without making code changes to either application.Which solution will

<strong>Question 980:</strong> A company has a three-tier application on
        AWS that ingests sensor data from its users’ devices. The traffic flows
        through a Network Load Balancer (NLB), then to Amazon EC2 instances for
        the web tier, and finally to EC2 instances for the application tier. The
        application tier makes calls to a database.What should a solutions
        architect do to improve the security of the data in transit?

<strong>Question 981:</strong> A company hosts a frontend application
        that uses an Amazon API Gateway API backend that is integrated with AWS
        Lambda. When the API receives requests, the Lambda function loads many
        libraries. Then the Lambda function connects to an Amazon RDS database,
        processes the data, and returns the data to the frontend application.
        The company wants to ensure that response latency is as low as possible
        for all its users with the fewest number of changes to the company's
        operations.Which solution will meet these requirements?
